Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages. It was created during the 1970s at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT CSAIL). This repository is a Python implementation of a Scheme Interpreter, which is Turing-complete, and supports basic programming fundamentals, including arithmetic operations, variables, if-else statements, lambda expressions, functions, recursion, iteration, file imports, and so much more. Below is a guide on basic Scheme syntax so that anyone can use the interpreter:


                                                              Python                 Scheme
             Arithmetic (applies to any operation)             2 + 3                 (+ 2 3)
                      
                      Variable Assignment                      x = 5               (define x 5)

                      Defining Function              def craft(stick, wood):    (define (craft stick wood)
                                                       function body...            function body...  )
